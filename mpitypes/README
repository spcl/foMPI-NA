MPITypes

MPITypes is an open source, portable library that enables the
construction of efficient MPI datatype processing routines outside
the MPI implementation. MPITypes enables programmers who are not
MPI implementors to create efficient datatype processing routines
for such purposes as copying data between structures or translating
data into portable data formats.
